# interview_kopernikus
The file [solution.pdf](https://github.com/sshetty1793/interview_kopernikus/blob/main/solution.pdf) contains my answers to the questions about the task.

I have added the my lines of code in the `main()` function of the `imaging_interview.py` file. Other scripts that I used for this task are stored in the scripts folder. Before running them, please make changes to the path of dataset in the code. Thank you. And please get back to me in case you need some clarification.
